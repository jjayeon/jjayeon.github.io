Homepage for jjayeon, aka Autumn Chiu.  I have some interesting projects on my GitHub, which I collect here.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Will install the necessary packages to run this project locally.  Do this before anything else.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

This will deploy the latest changes to https://autumnchiu.com.  Do this once you're happy with the changes in local.

There may be other npm commands but I do not use them.
