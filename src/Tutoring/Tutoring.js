            Are you looking for a tutor in Computer Science or Writing?  I can help with that. In high school, I achieved perfect scores (5/5) on the AP exams for Comp Sci A, Calculus AB, Calclus BC, Physics C-Mech, and Physics C-E&M, and an SAT score of 2300 (before they removed the writing section).  I applied and was admitted to the Cornell School of Engineering, and eventually graduated with a degree in English and Asian Studies after changing my major.  (More info on that in About.)

            I'm a strong test-taker and have excellent command of the subjects I specialize in, but more importantly, I am deeply familiar with the process of mastering a subject: where other students achieve mastery through natural talent, brute force, or sheer luck, I achieve it by studying the process of learning itself, and I am skilled at applying that knowledge in my teaching.

            The subjects I teach at the moment are Computer Science and Writing. More info on each below.

          <h3>Computer Science</h3>
          <p>
            The state of Computer Science education these days is honestly pretty dire; there are few teachers out there who have the deep technical knowledge to teach the subject well (which makes sense, since the people who do have that knowledge can make three times as much money working at Google or Amazon). If you or your child are struggling with Computer Science, it may very well be because you just haven't found a good teacher yet.

            I am a software engineer who does possess that deep technical knowledge, and I choose to teach despite the lower ROI because I would rather make the world a better place than make lots of money. (I would like to do both if I can, but I haven't figured that out quite yet.) If you hire me as a tutor, you will have access to expertise on computers and software that is normally not even on the market; and since I am mostly self-taught, I am also uniquely equipped to frame that expertise in a way that makes sense to a newcomer to the field.

          <h3>English and Writing</h3>
          <p>
            By now, from reading my website, you can probably tell that my command of English is quite good; it is what I went to school for, after all. Aside from having spent several years writing and refining both essays and fiction, I've also consulted on writing for graduate-level colleagues and helped secure grants and scholarships across different fields, including one Fulbright scholarship for creative writing. If want to learn techniques to give your writing some extra flair, or if you have an essay due soon that's in need of high-quality editing (or brainstorming to get started!), or if you're applying to college or graduate school and want to submit the best application possible, do reach out to me.
