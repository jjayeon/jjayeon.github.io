            Are you looking for a tutor in Computer Science, Math, Physics, or Writing?  I can help with that.  In high school, I achieved perfect scores (5/5) on the AP exams for Comp Sci A, Calculus AB, Calclus BC, Physics C-Mech, and Physics C-E&M, and an SAT score of 2300 (before they removed the writing section).  I applied and was admitted to the Cornell School of Engineering, and eventually graduated with a degree in English and Asian Studies after changing my major.  (More info on that in About.)

            I have helped many postgraduate colleagues secure positions and grants through written applications, including one Fulbright scholar, and in the meanwhile have studied enough programming independently to secure a full-time position as a software engineer.

            In short, I am intimately familiar with the mechanics of studying, test-taking, and learning, and have a wealth of experience tutoring students to impart them with the same knowledge.  I am someone who believes that learning does not stop at getting the "right" answer, but is a continuous process of getting familiar with your tools of knowledge, whether they're math formulas, computer code, or the written word.

            My promise as a tutor is that you will not just solve the problem in front of you, but you will get a deeper insight into how to solve problems in general; my hope is that you will come away from our sessions with a different eye towards problem-solving in all kinds of domains, just as I have across several fields and experiences.
